# PerfLite

This is an open source website that can be used to compare JavaScript performance
on your browser. It's really easy to host. The only dependency is to have a recent
version of node.js (with npm, but who doesn't have npm alongside node.js).

Run following code to setup and start a node server:

```
npm install
node server.js
```

After that, website is available under http://localhost:3000
